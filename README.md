# Pseudo_virtual_Assistant
This is my first project in university. A virtual assistant using only C.

1. Command line interface.
2. Look a like AI, but not actual AI.

*Don't delete those txt files from Grp 11 {SIRI} folder named "contact" "rest" and "online". 
*As this was my first semester and I didn't have any prior knowledge of OOP, it C is a functional language, so I didn't know anything about exception handling, but I figured it out by myself and handled those using conditions. Later on, during my 3rd semester, when I learned Java and OOP, I realized that whatever I did, that was exception handling by prevention of situation which can araise exception.
